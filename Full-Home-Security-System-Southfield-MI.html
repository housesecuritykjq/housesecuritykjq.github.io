<h2>The History Of Home Security Southfield</h2>
<p>Analog security cameras transmit lower resolution video over coax cable television and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can manage such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom. The DVR transforms the analog signal to digital, compresses it, and then stores it on a hard drive for later retrieval. Monitors can be connected to the DVR for viewing, or the system can be established to communicate through network or mobile app for viewing.</p>

<p>The combination of digital video surveillance and access control becomes part of the natural merging of security innovations. Centralizing security into a single user interface offers extra info that might never ever have been possible in the past, such as notification of a staff member, by name and identification number, entering the structure. An image of that employee is presented on screen for verification (verifying it's not a taken ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, guaranteeing no tailgating takes place.</p>

<p>The cover of darkness isn't enough to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does end up being a little bit of an issue is in between spotting and tape-recording movement. Because the Pro 2 does not do continuous video recording, it takes a second for the camera to in fact turn on when it discovers motion. If a wicked lawbreaker was quick enough, they could surpass the camera prior to it had time to record them.</p>

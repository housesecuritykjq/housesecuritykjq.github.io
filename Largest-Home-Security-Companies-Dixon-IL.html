The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (up to 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, often buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of up to 90 seconds in between videos.</p>
<p>Are privately owned, ran surveillance cameras to be treated the same way as public cameras? We also need to draw great lines about 'Who really is seeing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyway'? Big bro? The Corporates? Or bothering neighbour? Who fixes a limit in between public interest and harassment? At the minute, nobody! The camera might lawfully do what a peeping tom could not do.

<p>A security monitoring service includes an extra layer of protection by providing two-way direct communication with the main station monitoring operators. If your alarm is activated, designated authorities will be dispatched to your home or business' place.

<p>A self-monitored system should be smart. It needs to have the ability to follow guidelines with cause-and-effect relationships in between different gadgets.

Cameras that are not monitored by the main station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if requested by the client. </p>

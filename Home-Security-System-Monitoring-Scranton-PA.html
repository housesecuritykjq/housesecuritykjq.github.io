<h3>Security Alarm System Companies Scranton PA 18504</h3>
<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive plan, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016.

Although FrontPoint offers a wide variety of equipment and home automation items at an affordable cost, the one area where the company particularly stands out is in DIY installation. </p>

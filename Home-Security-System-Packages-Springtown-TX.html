<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, most burglar alarms work the specific very same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which suggests if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If somebody were to unlock that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical present to stream throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will set off.</p>

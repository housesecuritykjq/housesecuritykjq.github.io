<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize individuals the camera is finding utilizing face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those individuals and will send out smart device alerts with that info when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>

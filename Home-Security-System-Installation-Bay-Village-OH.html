<p>When purchasing security and surveillance devices, there are many elements to consider. First of all, examine your scenario and determine simply what you require.

Some models use your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and attach to the within your door, while others need that you remove your existing interior and exterior escutcheons and replace the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>

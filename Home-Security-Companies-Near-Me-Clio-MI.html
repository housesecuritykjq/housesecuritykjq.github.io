<p>Cameras frequently broadcast video online, enabling operators to monitor security camera feeds remotely. In many cases, surveillance systems are paid for and run by the cities themselves. However in other cases, residents and organisations share surveillance camera footage with policeman. Just like any security system, the more equipment you include, the more expensive it gets.

<h2>Managed Video Surveillance From Telstra Enterprise Boyertown</h2>

<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify individuals the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those people and will send out smartphone alerts with that info when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>

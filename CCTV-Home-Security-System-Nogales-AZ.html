<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most highly advanced outdoor camera we've evaluated. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between general motion and individuals, so it cuts down on incorrect alarms, and it can even determine people you've identified (after a learning period).

<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize individuals the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to determine those individuals and will send out smart device informs with that info when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise provide a broader variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>

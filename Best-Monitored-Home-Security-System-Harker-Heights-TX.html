We also found the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>

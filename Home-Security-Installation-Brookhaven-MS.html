Pro-installed systems usually cost more, usage equipment comparable to that of Do It Yourself systems, featured long and typically burdensome contracts, and often count on the same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they provide little benefit.

<p>Condo associations may prohibit locals from drilling holes in exterior walls. Locals of these homes might be far better off using a wireless security system. Wireless alarms are also ideal for occupants, as they can take the system with them when they move. Property owners, on the other hand, have a much greater degree of choice.

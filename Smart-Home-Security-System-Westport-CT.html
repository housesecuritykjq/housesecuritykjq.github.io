<p>Various types of CCTV cameras. All of the cameras were simple to install. Each camera has an app that strolls you through the setup procedure. This typically includes discovering a spot for your camera, developing an account in the app, and linking the camera to your Wi-Fi network.

These alerts can notify you to suspicious activity so you can monitor the scenario.</p>

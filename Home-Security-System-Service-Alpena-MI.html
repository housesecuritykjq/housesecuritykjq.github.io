<p>While every property owner frets about break-ins, hesitation has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complex contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces typically leading to false alarms. A security camera system is a whole video surveillance system connected together by a series of security cameras and network video recorders, providing dependable video monitoring around your home and business. 145 years ago, we developed security and alarm monitoring services. Today, we're reinventing the wise home. Firsts like Blue are what we do. Because they're so clearly identifiable as a security camera, they're an excellent deterrent too, and they're simple to mount almost anywhere. With the common weatherproof hoods, they're quite durable, but they don't constantly come with the full IP certification of other models.</p>

The Reolink Argus 2 is a budget friendly camera that still comes loaded with cool functions.</p>

<p>Now I pointed out this seemed like a stretch thinking about previous Sims video games had burglars, however my good friend pointed out the Sims 4 was made for a new generation, with a team of producers surrounded by individuals OF that generation who would mention that the intrusion of their home or safe location could develop feelings of pain or possible even setting off.

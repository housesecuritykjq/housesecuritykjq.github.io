At $24.99 each month, SimpliSafe's top-tier package is still extremely economical compared to the other companies on this list. It's practically a steal. The Interactive plan adds more control to the SimpliSafe system with mobile access and both text and e-mail notices.

<p>After evaluating dozens of wired and wireless options, the best home security camera for the majority of people is the Arlo Pro 2. It records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is completely wireless, and can be established both indoors and out, as it's weather condition resistant.

<p>Recording the video from your security cameras requires hard disk drives or cloud based storage. The digital video recorder (DVR) that the security cameras are connected to has a hard drive inside of it if you have an analog security camera system. If your dealing with recorded video storage on an IP camera system, then your network video recorder (NVR) can use hard disks for on-site recording and cloud-based recording in the event of hard disk malfunction.</p>

Expertly monitored security systems need a monthly monitoring charge that can range from ($ 20 to $60) per month.

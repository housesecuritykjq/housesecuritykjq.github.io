<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>

Likewise, it will arm itself immediately when everybody has left.</p>

But there's a plus side: Once you enter the contract, Protect America supplies the essential home security equipment free of charge without extra in advance expenses. You're just responsible for the regular monthly monitoring cost and any optional upgrades. There's also a rate match warranty.</p>

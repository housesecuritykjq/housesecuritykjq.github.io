<p>A taut wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to find any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to overlook things that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is set up to avoid this type of attack.</p>

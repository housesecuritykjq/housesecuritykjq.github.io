If you plan to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it concerns video items, we don't think that these problems alter the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our existing recommendation.</p>

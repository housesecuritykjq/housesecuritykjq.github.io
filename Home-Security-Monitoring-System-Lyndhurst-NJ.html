When a client presses the emergency situation button, it sends out double alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS.

And with video innovation most likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear borders for what CCTV systems should be able to do positions a considerable threat.</p>

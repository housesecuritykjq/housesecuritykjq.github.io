<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical since the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.

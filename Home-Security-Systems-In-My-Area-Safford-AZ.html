Like many home security companies, Vivint's equipment can be pricey, and paying at least $600 at the time of purchase may not fit into your budget. If you can swing it, however, month-to-month service is more versatile than a long-lasting agreement-- and helps you avoid potential termination fees.</p>
<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month charge for a set amount of time, generally one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which allow you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than committing to a long-term plan, are ending up being more common. These systems often cost more up front for the hardware than pro systems that offer a discount rate in exchange for that prolonged service agreement. Spending for the equipment in advance supplies you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can start and stop the monitoring service as often times as you want.</p>

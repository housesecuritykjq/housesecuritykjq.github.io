<h3>Cheapest Home Security System Monitoring in North Carolina</h3>

<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize individuals the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those individuals and will send out smartphone alerts with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We likewise discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a larger variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>

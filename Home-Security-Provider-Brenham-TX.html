<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft.

<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids speaking to somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively common. If a homeowner forgets their secrets and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is set off by a community cat, it can trigger the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the house owner will be contacted by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it rapidly. False alarms take place. With a self-monitored system, a property owner won't get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>

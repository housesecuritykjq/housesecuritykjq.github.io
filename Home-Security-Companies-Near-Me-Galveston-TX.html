<p>With an expertly monitored system, when a smoke or intrusion alarm is activated, an agent will first attempt to reach you via the two-way control panel before calling your noted telephone number. The agent will call 911 to dispatch an emergency situation responder to your home if you fail to respond. The nice feature of professionally installed systems is you don't have to raise a finger; after you've placed your order a specialist will pertain to your home, set whatever up for you, and show you how the system works.

<p>The Ring Alarm system also has a self-monitoring alternative, something that's unheard of amongst professionally set up systems.

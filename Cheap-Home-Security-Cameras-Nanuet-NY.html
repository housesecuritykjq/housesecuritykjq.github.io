<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the large quantity of data required by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and frequently over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for further circuitry.

Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera individually, usually by means of 110VAC power. </p>

<p>This is the best-scoring clever alarm we tested. It was extremely easy to establish, as the parts are pre-paired to the base station, and it fasted to activate when any of the sensors were activated. We like that it comes with both internal and external sirens and will even work with Philips Shade wise lights, too. The guidelines are exceptionally detailed and the 200m series of the alarm system suggests it can be used to secure sheds and garages along with your home.
